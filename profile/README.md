# Ethproofs

Ethproofs is a public-good platform tracking, benchmarking, and accelerating zk proving for Ethereum’s L1 on the path to **enshrined proofs**. We provide a neutral, research-grade interface—proof explorer, dashboards, and open schemas—to help the ecosystem move from pre-Phase 0 to real-time proving while preserving maximum decentralization.

Our mission is to make proving progress **credible, comparable, and verifiable**:
- Neutral data and clear provenance (verified vs. reported).
- In-browser verification, open-source tagging, and audit states.
- Research-friendly tables, exports, and APIs.

### Planning & Requirements

- **PRD (Ethproofs v3)** — the canonical product spec defining vision, features, and success metrics.  
  → See the PRD in the project-management repo: [`ethproofs/pm`](https://github.com/ethproofs/pm) and open the **PRD** there.  
  Direct link: **TODO**

- **Project Board** — roadmap and execution tracking for V3.  
  → See **Project Board** in [`ethproofs/pm`](https://github.com/ethproofs/pm).
